# hand-gesture-controlled-electronic-devices
Using hand gestures to control electronic devices using raspberry pi (without external camera). Camera of the PC is used to detect the gesture and raspberry py is used to controll the output.

For demo purpose I have controlled LED attached to Raspberry Pi's GPIO (pin number 15)


Hand gesture code is tweaked from repo https://github.com/sashagaz/Hand_Detection
